Some intr findings:
 1. Reconstruction Loss:
    - Beta-VAE is slightly worse at recreating images than **VAE**, but this is expected because it's trying to make its hidden space (latent space) more organized.

 2. KL Divergence:
    - Beta-VAE organizes its hidden space better, with less overlap between features. This makes it easier to understand and control.

 Beta-VAE trades a little image quality to create a hidden space that is cleaner and easier to interpret.
